        Bezier Editor
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>Simple Bezier curve editor with animation.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Shows how the Bezier point is calculated on a parametric curve
        by displaying the recursive line segments which make up each point on that curve.
      </p>

      <p>
        Using your mouse - click on either the end points (drawn as squares) or
        the control points (drawn as circles) and drag to its new position.
        Releasing the mouse will set the new position for the selected point.
      </p>
