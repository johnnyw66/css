Your Driver's number for Princes Cres walk 90 is '78'.

<br />
You can bundle up and walk on Aymer Road (with Princes Ave) and
Westbourne Place.
<br />
<br />

It may be possible (depending on parcel volume) to park HCT and walk Westbourne Villas.

<br />
<br />

I left my HCT at 13 Princes Cres (PC) to deliver to 'Barford Court' (157 Kingsway).
<br />
Just cross the road to get to back entrance.
<br />
155 Kingsway ('Beach House') has its door (white) on Princes Cres (after Number 3 PC).
<br />
You can leave your HCT on Kingsway Rd (just after 3 Princes Cres) to do the few places on east side of Kingsway (left to go to Hotel - 153 Kingsway)
